// Improved visual indicator
<View style={[styles.qiblaIndicator, { 
  backgroundColor: theme.primary,
  transform: [{ rotate: `${relativeQiblaAngle}deg` }]
}]}>
  <View style={[styles.qiblaArrow, { borderBottomColor: theme.primary }]} />
</View>
```

### Nearby Mosques Features
```tsx
// Platform-specific map integration
const openMaps = (mosque: Mosque) => {
  if (Platform.OS === 'ios') {
    Linking.openURL(`maps://app?q=${latitude},${longitude}`);
  } else {
    Linking.openURL(`geo:${latitude},${longitude}?q=${latitude},${longitude}`);
  }
};
```
