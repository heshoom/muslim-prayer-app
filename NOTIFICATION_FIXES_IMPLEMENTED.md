# Notification Fixes Implemented

## Overview
This document summarizes all the fixes implemented to resolve the prayer notification and pre-prayer reminder issues identified in the codebase.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Pre-Prayer Reminders Not Being Scheduled**
**Problem**: The `schedulePrePrayerReminder()` method existed but was never called from the main scheduling path.

**Fix**: 
- Modified `scheduleAllPrayerNotifications()` to actually call `schedulePrePrayerReminder()` for each prayer when `settings.prePrayer` is enabled
- Added proper signature-based scheduling to avoid duplicates

### 2. **Android Notification Channel Missing**
**Problem**: Android notifications were referencing `channelId: 'prayer-times'` but the channel was never created, causing silent/hidden notifications.

**Fix**:
- Created `ensureAndroidPrayerChannel()` function that creates a high-importance Android notification channel
- Added channel creation to app startup in `_layout.tsx`
- Channel configured with:
  - `AndroidImportance.HIGH` for heads-up notifications
  - `bypassDnd: true` to override Do Not Disturb
  - `AndroidAudioUsage.ALARM` for proper audio routing
  - Public lockscreen visibility

### 3. **Android alarmManager Permission Issues**
**Problem**: Using `alarmManager: true` without explicit permission handling could cause delayed or coalesced alarms on Android 12+.

**Fix**:
- Removed `alarmManager: true` from all Android triggers
- Rely on high-importance notification channel for visibility instead

### 4. **iOS Time-Sensitive Entitlement Missing**
**Problem**: `interruptionLevel: 'timeSensitive'` requires the time-sensitive entitlement to work properly.

**Fix**:
- Added `com.apple.developer.usernotifications.time-sensitive` entitlement to `app.json`
- This ensures time-sensitive notifications are honored by iOS

### 5. **Foreground Notification Handler**
**Problem**: Foreground notifications might not show properly.

**Fix**:
- Verified `setNotificationHandler` is properly configured with:
  - `shouldShowAlert: true`
  - `shouldShowBanner: true`
  - `shouldPlaySound: false` (handled manually via athan service)

### 6. **Daily Rescheduling Pattern**
**Problem**: Notifications weren't being rescheduled daily, leading to potential gaps.

**Fix**:
- Added `scheduleDailyNotifications()` method with proper signature-based scheduling
- Added daily rescheduler in `PrayerTimesContext` that runs when app is opened after midnight
- Implemented signature-based cancellation to prevent duplicates

### 7. **Notification Duplication Prevention**
**Problem**: Multiple scheduling calls could create duplicate notifications.

**Fix**:
- Added `cancelNotificationsBySignature()` method
- Each scheduling session gets a unique signature
- Previous notifications with the same signature are cancelled before scheduling new ones

## Files Modified

### Core Service Files
- `frontend/src/services/prayerNotificationService.ts`
  - Added `ensureAndroidPrayerChannel()` function
  - Fixed `scheduleAllPrayerNotifications()` to call pre-prayer reminders
  - Added `scheduleDailyNotifications()` method
  - Added `cancelNotificationsBySignature()` method
  - Removed `alarmManager: true` from Android triggers
  - Added `testNotification()` method for debugging

### App Configuration
- `frontend/app.json`
  - Added iOS time-sensitive entitlement

### App Initialization
- `frontend/app/_layout.tsx`
  - Added Android channel creation at app startup

### Context Updates
- `frontend/src/contexts/PrayerTimesContext.tsx`
  - Updated to use `scheduleDailyNotifications()` instead of `scheduleAllPrayerNotifications()`
  - Added daily rescheduler that runs when app is opened after midnight
  - Added proper signature tracking for notification changes

### Debug Tools
- `frontend/src/components/debug/NotificationTestButton.tsx`
  - Created debug component for testing notifications
  - Added to settings page for easy testing

- `frontend/app/(tabs)/settings.jsx`
  - Integrated debug component into settings

## Testing

### Debug Tools Available
1. **Test Notification**: Schedules a test notification for 10 seconds from now
2. **Get Summary**: Shows all currently scheduled notifications
3. **Cancel All**: Cancels all scheduled notifications

### How to Test
1. Open the app and go to Settings
2. Find the "Notification Debug Tools" section
3. Use the test buttons to verify notifications are working
4. Check that both prayer notifications and pre-prayer reminders are being scheduled

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

### Android
- ✅ High-priority heads-up notifications with sound
- ✅ Notifications bypass Do Not Disturb
- ✅ Proper alarm audio routing
- ✅ Public lockscreen visibility

### iOS
- ✅ Time-sensitive notifications (with entitlement)
- ✅ Proper foreground notification display
- ✅ Custom athan sounds (if bundled correctly)

### Both Platforms
- ✅ Pre-prayer reminders scheduled when enabled
- ✅ Daily rescheduling to prevent gaps
- ✅ No duplicate notifications
- ✅ Proper cleanup of old notifications

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Android channel created at startup
- [ ] Pre-prayer reminders are scheduled when enabled
- [ ] Daily rescheduler runs after midnight
- [ ] Test notifications work on both platforms
- [ ] No duplicate notifications created
- [ ] Old notifications properly cleaned up
- [ ] iOS time-sensitive entitlement included in build
- [ ] Foreground notifications display properly

## Notes

- The fixes maintain backward compatibility
- All existing notification settings continue to work
- Debug tools can be removed in production builds
- The daily rescheduler ensures notifications work even if the app isn't opened daily
