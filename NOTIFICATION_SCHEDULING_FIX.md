# 🔔 Prayer Notification Scheduling Fix

## Problem Identified
When users launched the app for the first time, all prayer notifications for the current day would fire immediately, even for prayers that had already passed. This caused a flood of notifications on app startup.

## Root Cause
The notification scheduling logic was using **repeating calendar triggers** for all prayer times without considering whether the prayer time had already passed for the current day. Repeating notifications try to "catch up" on missed occurrences, causing immediate delivery of past notifications.

### Original Logic (Problematic)
```typescript
// OLD CODE - Caused immediate notifications for past prayers
const prayerDate = new Date(today);
prayerDate.setHours(hours, minutes, 0, 0);

// If prayer time has passed today, schedule for tomorrow
if (prayerDate < new Date()) {
  prayerDate.setDate(prayerDate.getDate() + 1);
}

// PROBLEM: Always used repeating trigger, even when scheduling for "tomorrow"
trigger: {
  type: Notifications.SchedulableTriggerInputTypes.CALENDAR,
  hour: prayerDate.getHours(),
  minute: prayerDate.getMinutes(),
  repeats: true, // ❌ This causes catch-up notifications!
}
```

## Solution Implemented

### Smart Trigger Selection
The fix implements intelligent trigger selection based on whether the prayer time has passed:

1. **For prayers that haven't passed today**: Use a one-time trigger for today + separate repeating trigger for future days
2. **For prayers that have already passed**: Use repeating trigger starting from tomorrow

### New Logic (Fixed)
```typescript
// NEW CODE - Prevents immediate notifications
const now = new Date();
const hasPassedToday = notificationDate.getTime() <= now.getTime();

if (hasPassedToday) {
  // Prayer has passed - schedule repeating trigger for tomorrow onwards
  trigger = {
    type: Notifications.SchedulableTriggerInputTypes.CALENDAR,
    hour: hours,
    minute: minutes,
    repeats: true,
  };
} else {
  // Prayer hasn't passed - use one-time trigger for today
  trigger = {
    type: Notifications.SchedulableTriggerInputTypes.DATE,
    date: notificationDate, // ✅ Specific date/time, no catch-up
  };
  
  // Also schedule separate repeating notification for future days
  await scheduleRepeatingNotification(/* ... */);
}
```

## Files Modified

### 1. `/frontend/src/services/prayerNotificationService.ts`
- ✅ Fixed `schedulePrayerNotification()` method
- ✅ Added intelligent trigger selection logic
- ✅ Enhanced debugging with categorized notification logging
- ✅ Prevents immediate notifications for past prayer times

### 2. `/frontend/src/contexts/NotificationContext.tsx`
- ✅ Fixed `schedulePrayerNotifications()` method
- ✅ Applied same logic for both main prayers and pre-prayer reminders
- ✅ Added proper TypeScript typing for triggers

## Benefits of the Fix

### ✅ No More Notification Flood
- App startup no longer triggers past prayer notifications
- Users get clean, appropriate notification scheduling

### ✅ Proper Timing
- Upcoming prayers today get immediate one-time notifications
- Past prayers get scheduled for tomorrow with repeating pattern
- Pre-prayer reminders follow the same intelligent logic

### ✅ Enhanced Debugging
- Clear console logging shows which prayers are scheduled for today vs. tomorrow
- Categorized notification summary helps with troubleshooting

## Example Scenario

**Time**: 3:00 PM (15:00)  
**Today's Prayer Times**: Fajr 5:30, Dhuhr 12:30, Asr 16:00, Maghrib 19:15, Isha 20:45

### Before Fix (❌ Problematic)
```
🔔 Immediate notifications fire for:
- Fajr (already passed) ❌
- Dhuhr (already passed) ❌
- Asr (upcoming) ✅
- Maghrib (upcoming) ✅  
- Isha (upcoming) ✅
```

### After Fix (✅ Correct)
```
📅 Today's remaining notifications:
- Asr Prayer Time at 4:00 PM
- Maghrib Prayer Time at 7:15 PM
- Isha Prayer Time at 8:45 PM

🔁 Daily repeating notifications (starting tomorrow):
- Fajr Prayer Time daily at 05:30
- Dhuhr Prayer Time daily at 12:30
```

## Testing the Fix

1. **Clear app data** or use the debug reset onboarding button
2. **Set current time** to afternoon (after some prayers have passed)
3. **Enable notifications** in settings
4. **Check console logs** for proper categorization
5. **Verify no immediate notifications** fire for past prayers

## Technical Notes

- Both `prayerNotificationService.ts` and `NotificationContext.tsx` were updated for consistency
- TypeScript types properly declared for trigger inputs
- Enhanced logging helps distinguish between different notification types
- Pre-prayer reminders follow the same intelligent scheduling logic
