- `adhan.wav` - Traditional adhan sound for prayer notifications

To add the adhan sound:
1. Find a short adhan audio file (recommended: 10-15 seconds)
2. Convert it to WAV format
3. Name it `adhan.wav`

For testing purposes, you can use the default system notification sound by not including this file.
